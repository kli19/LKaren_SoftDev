      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <p>Foundation is a responsive front-end framework, meaning it is designed for and tested on numerous browsers and devices. It's components include a responsive grid, typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface elements.</p>

      <h1> Grid </h1>
      <p><b>Refer to lines</b></p>
      <p> Foundation comes with a 12-column flexible grid that can scale out to an arbitrary size and is easily nested. You can use this grid to easily created complicated layouts. The proportion of the cell size with respect to the screen size can change depending on the size of the screen. Let's use the notation s/m/l in which s, m, and l refer the number of columns a cell takes up when the screen is small, medium, and large, respectively.</p>
      <p> Try resizing the screen from small to medium to large to see how the 4/6/8 cell and the 8/6/4 cell change with respect to screen size. </p>
